# periscope-elastic-search

This library is part of the [Periscope] platform and contains Datatables.net grid implementation


## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```
  > **Note:** jspm queries GitHub to install semver packages, but GitHub has a rate limit on anonymous API requests. It is advised that you configure jspm with your GitHub credentials in order to avoid problems. You can do this by executing `jspm registry config github` and following the prompts.
5. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:

  ```shell
  jspm install -y
  ```
  >**Note:** Windows users, if you experience an error of "unknown command unzip" you can solve this problem by doing `npm install -g unzip` and then re-running `jspm install`.


6. To build the code, you can now run:

	```shell
	gulp build
	```
7. You will find the compiled code in the `dist` folder, available in three module formats: AMD, CommonJS and ES6.

8. See `gulpfile.js` for other tasks related to generating the docs and linting.



## Running The Tests

To run the unit tests, first ensure that you have followed the steps above in order to install all dependencies and successfully build the library. Once you have done that, proceed with these additional steps:

1. Ensure that the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) CLI is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

	```shell
	npm install -g karma-cli
	```
2. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following commnand:

	```shell
	npm install -g jspm
	```
3. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:

	jspm install
	```

4. You can now run the tests with this command:

	```shell
	karma start
